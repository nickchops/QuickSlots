Import into Marmlade 7.4 or newer and run.

No extra extensions needed.

Includes copies of a bunch of helper scirpts from my other Quick repositories.

Debugging is on by default. No optimisations (precompile etc) set up yet.

Currently has a "bug" (aka didn't hve time to code it) where you only win with the
3-in-a-row targets and not the two-apples-plus-another ones. Will fix that when I
have time!
